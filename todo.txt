// TODO
Once majority of these plugins are added / stable: refactor keymappings to more efficient maps

GO:
    go test coverage https://github.com/rafaelsq/nvim-goc.lua
    debugger
    update golint
    go implements list?
    find a way to get type definition from lsp.hover

git:
    tool for merging: should be able to use fugitive

file navigation options:
    window control. works with telescope and more https://github.com/anuvyklack/hydra.nvim
    harpoon https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon
    https://github.com/LukasPietzschmann/telescope-tabs
    https://github.com/kelly-lin/ranger.nvim

in file navigation optimizationss:
    https://github.com/ray-x/navigator.lua 
    better word jumping, aimed at code rather than text https://github.com/chrisgrieser/nvim-spider 
    learn treesitter textobjects 
    sneak like https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim
    like telescope symbol viewer but aims at navigating the current file  https://github.com/SmiteshP/nvim-navbuddy | can telescope do this?

quality of life:
    dashboard https://github.com/nvimdev/dashboard-nvim or  https://github.com/startup-nvim/startup.nvim
    telescope compatible clipboard https://github.com/AckslD/nvim-neoclip.lua

/*
- need to set all shortcuts to be available when it can be used. I think this is when buffers are loaded? e.g only get go tools in a go file
- telescope references
- telescope jump to places might be clashing with zoxide. I am getting two lots of previews
*/


// symbols outline pinned side (does telescope provide enough of this) | does the go version offer better structure?
https://github.com/crusj/structrue-go.nvim  // symbols for go with pane and peek windows

// code action menu. If this menu displays all code actions in the file might be worth
https://github.com/weilbith/nvim-code-action-menu

// ui for all the lsp actions. This could be good early and once used to things delete
https://github.com/jinzhongjia/LspUI.nvim/wiki/Screen-Shot

// mild highlight on duplicate words // this might be annoying
https://github.com/RRethy/vim-illuminate

// searchable cheat sheet // I think I would like to build one rather than use this
