Base editor complete. Follow up by writing more code myself
-> start optimizing lazy starts where possible
-> lang files should be a module with a plugins var and setup vars
-> is blink theme working?

Upcoming plugins to test:
- octo for github -> use `use_local_fs` = true
- oil-git as replacement: https://github.com/benomahony/oil-git.nvim
- https://github.com/aaronik/treewalker.nvim
