TODO:
- refactor keymappings to more efficient maps
  - sort out testing / debugging -> remove overlap with diagnostics
- only attach commands based on buffer. e.g all go commands can move into <leader>l once I attach them to go files
- go through each plugin and stabalize (optimize/ clean). Is it needed? 

Learn: 
- treesitter text objects
- testing + debuggin
- fugitive git merge
